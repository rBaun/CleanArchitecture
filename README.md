# CleanArchitecture
Example of [Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture](https://www.google.com "Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture") implemented in ASP.NET

The goal of this project is to create a demo with a CLEAN Architecture approach. 
The demo will include 4 different layer:
* Domain Layer
* Application Layer
* Infrastructure Layer
  * Infrastructure.IoC Layer
  * Infrastructure.Persistence Layer
* Presentation Layer
The purpose is to get a clear understanding of how to take the clean approach to writing code. This demo can be re-used to any project and 
can be adjusted to fit any requirements. This means that the CLEAN approach is not limited to the chosen layers, but can be complimented according to your needs.
